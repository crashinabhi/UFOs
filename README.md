## Summary
- Although this added capability will help to narrow down the search results there are some drawbacks to this. When the list of sightings will go on increasing it will be difficult to filter to the desired results with out knowing all the available options to filter. A drop-down option will be more helpful to filter to the desired sightings.
- As mentioned above a drop-down menu in the filter section can be a good user-friendly option to improve user experience
- Also inserting links to photos available about the sightings can be a option to attract more views to the webpage.
- data from other countries can also be collected to be added in this to help viewers to have a global reach of the sightings and their similarities.
